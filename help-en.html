        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>
            This is a tool for planning a valid Warframe Clan Dojo layout.  I've tried to model the in-game
            room boundaries and constraints as accurately as possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            <strong class="warn">All the room boundaries have been found by in-game experiment, waypoint
                measurement, or straight-up guesswork.</strong>  If you see a problem or if you'd like to help me
            determine bounds and stats for the old, discontinued rooms then please drop me a line!
        </p>

        <h1>Getting started</h1>
        <p>
            The starter <strong>Clan Hall</strong> is already added by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click the <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-add.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-add.png 2x" title="Add"/></span> button to select a category and room to add.
            Then drag and click where the room should be placed.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you drag one room so one of its doors is close to another room's door that's facing the opposite
            direction, then all of your currently selected rooms will be snapped to connect those doors.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The zone of sensitivity with door snapping does not change with zoom.  If you're having trouble
                snapping a room to the correct door then try zooming in.</li>

            <li>If the rotation was triggered while dragging rooms, the room that was clicked to start the
                drag operation is the center of rotation.</li>
            <li>If you're just using the <strong>R</strong> key with a set of selected rooms, then the center of

            there are four options for selecting rooms with similar colors.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Select Exact</strong>: Selects all rooms in the dojo with the same hue, saturation, and
                brightness settings.</li>
            <li>
                <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-color.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-color.png 2x" title="Hue"/></span>:
                Selects all rooms in the dojo with the same hue, regardless of other color settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-sat.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-sat.png 2x" title="Saturation"/></span>:
                Selects all rooms in the dojo with the same saturation, regardless of other color settings.

                Selects all rooms in the dojo with the same brightness, regardless of other color settings.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If there are already some rooms with colors in the layout, then those colors will create markers on the
            saturation, and luminance sliders.  Moving any slider close enough to a mark will snap to them.  The
            snapping can be disabled by holding the shift key.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have multiple rooms selected that currently have different colors, then only the color parts that
            are modified will be changed.  For example, if you have a red and a green room selected, and only adjust
            the brightness slider without touching hue, then the rooms will still be red and green and only their
            brightness will be changed.

            The Label object does not count towards the resource totals or dojo boundaries.  It allows you to place

        <h1 id="Constraints">Constraints</h1>
        <p>
            There are three types on constraints on room placemement: <strong>Room Resources</strong>,
            <strong>Room Boundaries</strong>, and <strong>Room Rules</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="RoomResources">Room Resources</h2>
        <p>
            There are three constraints that affect all rooms in the Dojo:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Room Count:</strong> There's a hard limit of 128 rooms total.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy:</strong> Each room requires some amount of Energy.  You must build
                <strong>Reactors</strong> to increase the available energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Each room requires some amount of Capacity.  You must build
                <strong>Clan Halls</strong> or other Halls to get more capacity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The current Room count, Energy, and Capacity of your dojo is displayed in the lower left.  When any
            of those resources is exceeded it will be highlighted in <span class="docButton-error">red</span>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="RoomBoundaries">Room Boundaries</h2>
        <p>
            If you move a room too close to another room so that their boundaries overlap then they will be
            highlighted in <span class="docButton-error">red</span>.  The dojo layout is invalid as long as there
            are any room boundaries overlapping.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that rooms on adjacent floors may also overlap boundaries.  If a currently visible room is
            overlapping with a room on a different floor then you will see just the other room's boundary in
            <span class="docButton-error">red</span>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="SpecialNoteAboutDryDock">Special Note About the Dry Dock</h3>
        <p>
            The Dry Dock is <strong>very big</strong>.  The outline and bounds visible on the Dry Dock do not
            extend all the way to the back of it, which extends roughly 6-7 times farther than the visible size of
            the Dry Dock.  Boundary collisions with the entire length of the Dry Dock will still be detected, but
            it may not be obvious what's colliding unless you zoom out and find the Dry Dock.
        </p>
        <h3 id="SpecialNoteAboutDiscontinued">Special Note About the Discontinued Rooms</h3>
        <p>
            The old, discontinued dojo rooms are available to place in your layout.  <strong class="warn">They come
            with a warning icon <span class="docImgButton-clear"><img src="icons/icon-warn.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-warn.png 2x" title="Warning"/></span>
            because there are number of caveats:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I have gotten some help testing the old room boundaries (huge thanks to <strong>x-cessive</strong>).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, even with testing, the discontinued rooms are going to be a bit looser than the others.  They
            don't follow a standard grid.  And since I don't have them in my dojo, I can't test them on an
            ongoing basis.  Finally, there are still some assumptions I have to make:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I'm assuming that the <strong>Old Reactor</strong> provides the same 25 energy as a newer reactor
            </li>
            <li>
                For everything else I'm assuming they use zero energy and consume zero capacity.
            </li>
            <li>
                I'm assuming all the old rooms have the height and depth of the starter <strong>Clan Hall</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="RoomRules">Specific Room Rules</h2>
        <p>
            There are a handful of constraints that apply to specific rooms:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You need at least one <strong>Spawn Room</strong>.  These are marked in the room menus with
                a <span class="docImgButton-clear"><img src="icons/icon-spawn-supported.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-spawn-supported.png 2x" title="Spawn Supported"/></span>
                icon.  Possible spawn rooms are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Any of the Classic <strong>Clan Halls</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Inspiration Hall</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Entrati Audience Chamber</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Infested Chamber</strong></li>
                </ul>
                See below for more on <a href="#SpawnRoom">Spawn Rooms</a>.
            </li>
            <li>An <strong>Oracle</strong> is the prequisite for all the Labs</li>
            <li>You can only have one of each classic <strong>Clan Hall</strong></li>
            <li>You can only have up to three <strong>Inspiration Halls</strong></li>
            <li>You can only have up to five <strong>Obstacle Course Architect</strong> rooms</li>
            <li>You can only have one of each type of <strong>Barracks</strong>, and each
                tier Barracks is the prerequisite for the next one.</li>
            <li>You can only have one <strong>Dry Dock</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When a room is violating a specific rule then it will be highlighted in <span class="docButton-error">red</span>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="ConstraintFeedback">Other Constraint Feedback</h2>
        <p>
            When a room is violating a resource, boundary, or rule constraint it will be highlighted in <span class="docButton-error">red</span>.
            Clicking on the room twice to bring up the room menu.  Beside the room name will be a
            <span class="docImgButton-clear"><img src="icons/icon-error.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-error.png 2x" title="Error"/></span>
            button.  Clicking on it will bring up a list of the constraints that the room is breaking.
        </p>
        <p>
            The floor indicator along the left side of the screen will hightlight in <span class="docButton-error">red</span>
            any floors containing rooms with constraint violations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-add.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-add.png 2x" title="Add Room"/></span>

            buttons next to rooms that will have a constraint violation if added.  This also applies to the
            <strong class="docButton">Duplicate</strong> option in the individual room menus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, in the top bar there is a global error icon, either
            <span class="docImgButton-clear"><img src="icons/icon-ok.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-ok.png 2x" title="OK"/></span>,
            <span class="docImgButton-clear"><img src="icons/icon-error.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-error.png 2x" title="Error"/></span>, or

            Click on it to bring up a list of all errors or warnings detected in the dojo.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Resources">Resources</h2>
        <p>
            When adding or duplicating a room, next to the energy and capacity constraints will be a
            <span class="docImgButton-clear"><img src="icons/icon-resources.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-resources.png 2x" title="Resources"/></span>
            resources button.  Clicking this will display the resources needed to build that room, considering
            the current clan tier.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the bottom of the screen, next to the total rooms, energy, and capacity, is another
            <span class="docImgButton-clear"><img src="icons/icon-resources.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-resources.png 2x" title="Resources"/></span>

        </p>
        <h1 id="ClanTier">Clan Tier</h1>
        <p>
            The <strong>Clan Tier</strong> is determined by highest tier Barracks room that is present.  There are

        <p>The current Clan Tier is displayed at the bottom of the screen next to Clan Affinity and Resources.</p>
        <p>
            All resources displayed will be for the current Clan Tier of the layout.  <span class="warn">Note that

        <h1 id="ClanAffinity">Clan Affinity</h1>
        <p>
            Some of the rooms you can build provide <strong>Clan Affinity</strong> when they're built for the first

        </p>
        <h2 id="XPRooms">Clan Affinity Rooms</h2>
        <p>
            The 11 rooms that currently provide <strong>Clan Affinity</strong> are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oracle</li>

        </p>
        <p>
            When Advanced Structure Mode is enabled your dojo layout will be overlayed with green lines.
            This shows the internal structure of your dojo as it would exist inside the game.
        </p>
        <h3 id="TreeView">Your Dojo is a Tree</h3>
        <p>
            Whenever you add a room do your dojo, you start with a door.  The door you use to create a new room
            creates a parent-child relationship between the rooms on either side.  The room built first is the
            parent, the room bult second is the child.  <strong class="warn">This build order is mostly set in
            stone.</strong>  It's there until those room are destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you start from any room, then the build order of its child rooms, and their child rooms, and their
            child rooms, etc., branch out like a tree.  Computer science has a technical term for this kind of
            structure.  It's called a "tree".  Computer Science is not good at naming things.
        </p>
        <p>
            The root of this tree is your Spawn Room.  The branch that starts at your Spawn Room contains all
            other branches inside it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Advanced Structure Mode is enabled, DojoCAD will try to build the tree structure from your layout,
            starting with the spawn room.  It will be able to do so automatically, <strong class="warn">unless
            your layout contains <a href="#Loops">loops</a>.</strong>
        </p>

        <h4 id="TreeDisplay">Tree Structure Display</h4>
        <p>
            The tree structure is shown in Advanced Structure Mode as green arrows over the doors, pointing from
            parent room to child room.  These arrows are joined by lines through the center of each room.  Each
            room's center is highlighted with a larger green square.
        </p>

        <h4 id="SelectBranch">Select Branch</h4>
        <p>
            When Advanced Structure Mode is enabled and your layout has a valid tree structure the room menu  will
            have a few more options for selecting rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select a single room and use <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-select-branch.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-select-branch.png 2x" title="Branch"/></span>
            <strong>Branch</strong> to select all the child rooms branching out from that room.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="info">In-game, the branch under a room represents all the rooms that must be destroyed
                before that room can be destroyed, assuming your spawn room stays the same.</strong>
        </p>
        <h4 id="SelectRoot">Select Root</h4>
        <p>
            Select a single room and use
            <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-select-root.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-select-root.png 2x" title="Root"/></span>
            <strong>Root</strong> to select the path of parent rooms from that room leading back to the Spawn Room.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="info">In-game, the root path leading leading back to the spawn room represents all the
                rooms that must be built before that room can be built, assuming your spawn room stays the same.</strong>
        </p>

        <h4 id="MovingTheSpawnRoom">Moving the Spawn Room</h4>
        <p>
            If the layout has a valid tree structure, then the spawn room can be moved anywhere and it will still
            be a valid tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the spawn room is moved from one side of a room to the other along the tree, then the branch
            structure for that room changes. Its previous parent becomes one of its child branches, and one of
            it's previous child rooms becomes its parent.  This is sometimes helpful in destroying a room while
            preserving one of its previous child rooms, but it practice it's is pretty hard to avoid destroying
            tons of other rooms.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Loops">Loops</h3>
        <p>
            <strong class="info">The defining characteristic of a tree is that branches don't connect again
                after branching out.</strong>  With valid a tree there is no way to return a room you already
            visited without retracing your steps.  You must ultimately end up at the end of a branch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obviously, you <i>can</i> build a dojo with a loop in it.  So what's going on?
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll notice that no other map in the game has loops in it.  Explore the map on any in-game mission and
            you'll only find dead ends.  There are no large-scale loops involving multiple rooms.  It seems only
            dojos can have those.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm pretty sure that under the covers, it's still the same basic engine driving both mission maps and
            dojos.  Both use tree structures to define the layout in terms of branches.  However, dojos have a
            special kind of door that can cross between two branches.  I'm calling this a <strong>Cross Branch
            Door</strong> because I'm not good at naming things, either.
        </p>

        <h4 id="LoopDetection">Loop Detection</h4>
        <p>
            When Advanced Structure Mode is enabled, any loops detected will be shown in two ways.  The rooms
            involved in the loop wll be as highlighted as warnings in yellow.  And the doors involved in the loop
            will have bi-directional yellow arrows on them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that if you have a complicated layout then it's possible to have a some rooms involved in more
            than one loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="warn">Most of the Advanced Structure Mode features, like selecting branches and root
                paths, are not available until the loops have been resolved.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3 id="CrossBranchDoors">Cross Branch Doors</h3>
        <p>
            Click on the arrow above any door to bring up a small menu.  Use

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="info">Cross Branch Doors are allowed to be connected, but they are not counted when

            to reset the Cross Branch Door setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="warn">Note that breaking a door connection by moving or deleting a room will also clear
                any Cross Branch setting that may have been on that door.</strong>
        </p>

        <h4 id="HowCrossBranchDoors">How to find cross branch doors</h4>
        <p>
            If you're using DojoCAD to model an existing dojo then the Cross Branch Doors are already in place
            in your dojo.  You just have to go into the game and find where they are.  This can be tedious, but
            it's not difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you try to destroy a room, one of two things happens:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You get a prompt asking if you really want to queue the room for destruction.  This means the room
                you're in is at the end of a branch and has no child rooms.
            </li>
            <li>
                You get a message about child components, and the option to show them in the minimap.  This will
                highlight child rooms with blue markers on the in-game map.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong class="warn">Note that you don't actually have to go through with destroying the room.</strong>
            Just getting far enough to see one of those two prompts is good enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            Figuring out Cross Branch doors from these two results is a bit of a puzzle, but there's a simple rule:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="info">If you find a door that is never highlighted when trying to destroy the rooms on
                both sides, then that is a Cross Branch door.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting this into practice:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pick a room in your dojo that has a looping warning in DojoCAD, and try to destroy it.  <strong>Not
                your Spawn Room.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                If you get the prompt to queue it for destruction immediately, then pick any door along the loop and
                go to step 4.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you get the child room prompt, then tell it to show child rooms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Follow the loop through doors with blue icons on them until you reach a room where the icon is on a
                console, or until you reach a room where the next door in the loop doesn't have the icon on it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Go through that door and try to destroy that room.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you get the prompt to queue it for destruction immediately, then go to step 8.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you get the child room prompt, then tell it to show child rooms.  The door you just went through
                should <i>not</i> have the blue icon on it.
            </li>
            <li>
                In DojoCAD, mark that door you just went through as a Cross Branch Door.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat until DojoCAD doesn't show any more loops.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong class="warn">Steps 5, 6, and 7 may not always be necessary, but it's good to check yourself.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have the tree structure from your in-game dojo mapped in DojoCAD, you can start using the
            <strong>Select Branch</strong> and <strong>Select Root</strong> along with spawn room manipulation
            to figure out the best way to destroy rooms in your dojo.
        </p>

        <h2 id="StructureMenu">Structure Menu</h2>
        <p>
            There are more options available under the

        <h3 id="ShowSpawnRoom">Find Spawn Room</h3>
        <p>
            If you have a big dojo or otherwise can't find the spawn room, use

            <strong>Find Spawn Room</strong> to automatically show your spawn room and select it.
        </p>

        <h3 id="AutoFixStructure">Auto-Fix Structure</h3>
        <p>
            If you're designing a layout from scratch and don't want to deal with resolving loops manually, then use
            <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-structure-fix.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-structure-fix.png 2x" title="Auto-fix Structure"/></span>
            <strong>Auto-Fix Structure</strong> to automatically set any Cross Branch Doors necessary to resolve
            loops and make the structure at valid tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Auto-Fix Structure</strong> will try to create the shortest branches possible, according to
            your current Spawn Room.  Shorter branches means the dojo can be completed faster and torn down faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there are already some Cross Branch Doors set then they will be left alone.
        </p>

        <h3 id="ResetAllStructure">Reset All Structure</h3>
        <p>
            To reset all the Cross Branch doors in the layout, use

            <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-settings.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-settings.png 2x" title="Settings"/></span> to
            open Settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Settings are stored with your browser, so opening DojoCAD again should restore the same settings you
            had before.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ShowAllFloors">Show all Floors</h2>
        <p>
            By default, while viewing one floor all the other floors will be shown grayed out in the backgorund.
            If that gets too cluttered, or if it's lagging your browser, then that can be disabled with the
            <strong>Show All Floors</strong> setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have <strong>Show All Floors</strong> disabled then you can still select rooms on
            other floors using <strong>Ctrl-Shift-A</strong>, <strong>Ctrl-Shift-drag</strong>, and
            the various methods for selecting rooms of the same type or color.  The other rooms will
            only show up when selected.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ShowMapMarkers">Show Map Markers</h2>
        <p>
            By default, the map markers for certain rooms like labs and the Dry Dock are displayed.  Use the
            <strong>Show Map Markers</strong> setting to turn that off.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this setting also applies to images generated with the PNG function.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ShowLabels">Show Labels</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes labels can clutter things up when you're editing.  Use the <strong>Show Labels</strong>
            setting to turn off labels without removing them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this setting also applies to images generated with the PNG function.  You also cannot edit
            labels unless <strong>Show Labels</strong> is enabled.
        </p>
        <h2 id="DimRooms">Dim Rooms</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes bright room colors can make reading labels or looking at Advanced Structure Mode more
            difficult.  Use the <strong>Dim Rooms</strong> setting to make the actual rooms darker.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have to be honest.  This setting is only here to make Advanced Structure Mode look cool.
        </p>
        <h2 id="EnableRules">Enable Rules</h2>
        <p>
            Use this setting to turn off rules for room limits, prerequisites, energy, and capacity.  When disabled
            those things will not be checked and will not add errors to the rooms and the layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong class="warn">Note that this not affect collision errors, which are still checked.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2 id="Autosave">Autosave</h2>
        <p>
            If the <strong>Autosave</strong> setting is enabled, then as you edit your layout it will be automatically
            saved to <a href="#LocalStorage">Local Storage</a> under an special <strong>Autosave</strong> entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you open DojoCAD with no layout in the link, it will automatically load anything
            currently saved as an <strong>Autosave</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have an Autosave but you accidentally load a DojoCAD link with a layout, your original autosave
            will still be there in Local Storage until you actually make an edit.
        </p>

        <h1 id="Language">Language</h1>
        <p>
        <p>
            If DojoCAD supports the default language set on your browser, then it should be applied automatically.
            To select a different language, click
            <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-burger.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-burger.png 2x" title="Menu"/></span> then
            <span class="docImgButton"><img src="icons/icon-language.png" srcset="icons2x/icon-language.png 2x" title="Language"/></span>
            and open the <strong>Language</strong> menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will show all the languages currently supported by DojoCAD.  Selecting one will apply it immediately.
            This setting is stored with your browser, so opening DojoCAD again should automatically use the same
            language you selected before.

            Below the Obstacle Course is a huge fog plane that extends well beyond its actual boundaries.  If you

                will still work (thanks <strong>u/Almagnus1</strong>)</li>
            <li>Added wall displays for the Dry Dock 1 floor below and 3 floors above to make it more clear that
                you can't build any rooms there (thanks <strong>u/Almagnus1</strong>)</li>
            <li>Adjusted rules for Hall prerequisites and added a new rule to make sure you have at least one hall
                (Thanks <strong>u/yarl5000</strong>)</li>
            <li>Fixed lower boundary for Dry Dock (thanks <strong>(PC) KCToxic</strong>)</li>
            <li>Fixed boundary for Crimson Branch (thanks <strong>KingOfYou115</strong> and
                <strong>u/Ramarr</strong>)</li>

        <h3 id="UpdateNotes1.2">v1.2: 2020-01-22</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Added my best guess at the old, discontinued rooms.  <strong class="warn">Note that the dimensions,

            <li>Shift-clicking a room automatically selects it for dragging, so you don't have to click every room

            <li>Fixing bounds on Courtier's Bliss and Harbinger's Pass, implementing a whole new routine around
                bounds checking because the bounds on these two rooms don't make sense specifically when paired
                against the Dry Dock. (thanks <strong>BobVonBob</strong>, <strong>justawarframeuser</strong>)</li>
            <li>After testing in a second account, tweaked the bounds on the Dry Dock and simplified the bounds on

            <li>Added a lab icon for Dagath's Hollow because somebody has to</li>
            <li>Adjusted bounds on the old Obstacle Course and the Chem Lab.  You can place the Chem Lab and

                (thanks <strong>Dreamwalk3r</strong>)</li>

        <h3 id="UpdateNotes3.0">v3.0: 2024-02-22</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed link format to put the layout data into a URL anchor instead of a query parameter, which
                simplifies a lot of things around opening very large layout links.  Old URLs still work, and will be
                converted to the new format on load.</li>
            <li>Prepared the app for translation by extracting every piece of displayable text into a resource bundle
                and adding a language selection menu.</li>

            <li>
                If you're on a phone, the UI doesn't fit very well in landscape mode.
            </li>
            <li>
                In Mobile Chrome you can still hide the URL bar and mess up the layout.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are still some z-index issues, basically visible as a room you're dragging appearing to go
                underneath other rooms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Similarly, there are issues with trying to select a room that's within the bounding box of another
                room
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking an internal link in the Help section in Chrome will flicker the screen, because some
                things in Chrome are very stupid.  Possibly this also happens in mobile Safari, too.
            </li>
            <li>
                Speaking of Safari, it pops when you switch floors to a floor with rooms off the screen.
            </li>
            <li>
                PNGs exported with Safari look like ass.
            </li>
            <li>
                Color coding doesn't work when generating PNGs on Safari.
            </li>
            <li>
                Safari is really, really slow with a large dojo.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't use Safari
            </li>
            <li>
                You can't click anywhere on the color slider to select a color, you have to drag the button.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Local Storage listing doesn't have a scrollbar, so you can add more entries than the screen can
                contain.
            </li>
            <li>
                There's some rare bug with connecting rooms where it doesn't register that it's connected, but I
                haven't been able to track it down.
